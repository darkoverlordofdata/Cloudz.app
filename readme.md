# Cloudz, man ...

Similar to PeppermintOS Ice, but that uses GTK.
This is written using PyQT5, so I guess I could call it IceQT???

Ice stores metatada in 2 locations:
    ./.mozilla
    ./.local/config/ice

Cloudz... stores metddata underneath the application, i.e.:
    /Application/Cloudz/<Appname>/Resources/profiles

```
                Cloudz
